			I'm a recent graduate in Computer Science specializing in Artificial Intelligence from the
			esteemed University of Brighton. Passionate about emerging technologies, I am committed to
			leveraging AI to create solutions that drive efficiency and innovation. During my studies, I
			had the opportunity to work on various projects that allowed me to hone my programming and
			problem-solving skills. My hands-on experience includes working with languages such as Python,
			Java, and C++, Html, Css, JavaScript, as well as frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch
			Svelte, React, Vue. Some key highlights from my academic journey include: Leading a team
			project to develop an AI-powered recommendation system that demonstrated a 20% improvement in
			user engagement. Completing an internship at Juhayna, where I contributed to optimizing
			machine learning algorithms for real-world applications. Publishing a research paper on
			Natural Language Processing (NLP) in collaboration with my professors, focusing on sentiment
			analysis in social media. I am constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow within the
			tech industry. Currently, I am open to entry-level positions where I can apply my knowledge in
			AI and software development to create impactful solutions. I am particularly interested in
			roles that allow for collaboration, creativity, and the chance to contribute to cutting-edge
			projects. Feel free to connect with me or send a message if you'd like to discuss potential
			opportunities, collaboration, or simply want to chat about the exciting world of AI!
